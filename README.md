Punch the Monkey Game
=====================

## Here's what you need:



1. an image of a monkey



2. an image of a fist



3. your mouse cursor moves the fist on the screen



4. the monkey moves around the screen at random



5. when you click on the monkey, it spins around for a second, and you get a point, and the monkey now moves at a faster speed.



6. when you click off the monkey, the monkey jumps up and down and you lose the game.



7. get ten points to win the game.

use HTMLCanvasElement and CanvasRenderingContext2D apis to get the job done
a few bonuses: preloading images, audio, independent title, play, win, lose, and credits screens.
